              <p class="a">The People</p>
              <p>$wag the Dog was founded by pet lovers who are equally avid followers of fashion. We loved the idea of looking after our pets and keeping them warm and safe but in style, but when we looked around we could see that there were a lot of clothes available for pets but nothing that could be described as couture or high fashion. We wanted to dress our pets in high fashion and have them looking like a million dollars, so based on that concept that we launched $wag the Dog</p>

              <p class="a">The Philosophy </p>

              <p>$wag the Dog is here to provide the fashion conscious with stylish unrivalled couture for their pets. The range provides all the clothing and accessories that your dog would ever need from stylish coats and pretty dresses to stunning lead & collar sets.</p>
